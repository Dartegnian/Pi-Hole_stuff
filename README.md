# WHAT IS A PI-HOLE?
**It's a network-wide ad blocker**. In layman's terms, a "Pi-hole" is a device connected on a **network** that blocks ads on devices that are connected to it. It's usually a **Raspberry Pi** and it's a "black hole" where adverts get sucked in, hence "Pi-hole."

# What is this repository about?
This repository contains all the configs and settings I have for my Pi-hole. This contains all my *block* lists as well as my *black*list and *white*list. That's all there is to it.
